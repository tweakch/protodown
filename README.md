# protodown
An experimental project using markdown to generate application prototypes

## The Idea
Prototyping is one of the most important steps in development. It lets you test ideas and see what road you want to go down. 

Most of the time, successful prototypes will be used as a scaffold for the first iteration of your application. 

**protodown**Â lets you describe your prototype in words - following a set of simple rules - and then generate the scaffolding for your application.
